# KeyloggerFooler

This is an example of a password entry system that would fool a keylogger. It is based on iblacksand's KeyloggerFooler. It sends simulated keys to a hidden textbox, filters out the user-input keys, and puts them into a different textbox. It is far from perfect and is meant to be used as a proof of concept.
